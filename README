Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')
  --> Entire Milestone 1.

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  (list extra-credit tasks)
  --> Not this time.

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  (include detailed instructions, or write 'None')

  --> Like others, my server did not run with the command suggested in the writeup.  After running ant build, I needed to add the logger jar file to the class path manually.  
    This is the template of a command that runs my server:
        java -cp bin:lib/log4j-1.2.9.jar edu.upenn.cis.cis455.webserver.HttpServer PORT ROOTDIR
    For example (from the hw1/ directory):
        java -cp bin:lib/log4j-1.2.9.jar edu.upenn.cis.cis455.webserver.HttpServer 8080 ./www/
